There are 3 main ways to access models in this repository...

- **Raw Layers:** These are the layers that make up a model. This is the most primitive form of models.
- **Generated Textures:** These are .asset textures generated automatically in-game. (2D array of pixel colors)
- **Compiled Sprites:** These are .png files that have the compiled model. This is the best way to view models.
