There are 3 main ways to access models in this repository...

- **Raw Layers:** These are multiple .png layers that make up an entities model in-game.
- **Generated Textures:** These are .asset textures generated automatically by some of my editor extensions.
- **Compiled Sprites:** These are .png files of each compiled model. This is the best way to view models.
